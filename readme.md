## Main Idea
Calmy is the simplest mood tracker in the industry. You just need to choose the color of your mood that you feel right now.

## GOALS
1. Our main goal is to help people who are experiencing mental problems to track their own state. The realization that any black stage of life is not eternal helps to experience depressive episodes in a calmer state. Helps you accept your own state.
2. Long-term plans â€“ on the basis of user data (which will be collected anonymously, encrypted and with the consent of users) to make predictions about the time of depressive episodes of a person, as well as on the basis of machine learning to determine such diseases in a person as: bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, psychosis.
